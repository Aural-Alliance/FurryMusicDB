        <p class="card-text">
            The Furry Music Database is an
            <a href="https://www.auralalliance.page/" target="_blank">Aural Alliance</a>
            project. It's developed and maintained by
            <a href="https://silvereagle.dev/" target="_blank">Silver Eagle</a>.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
            We are passionate about music, furry culture, and creating a platform that brings these two worlds closer
            together.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
            The Furry Music Database is meant to be a space for discovering music created by members of the furry
            community. The music here doesn't necessarily have to be "furry" in nature, and we don't heavily moderate
            what kinds of music can be listed here.

        <h2 class="subtitle">Our Mission</h2>

        <p class="card-text">
            One big reason the furry music scene is so under-appreciated is the lack of a good place to discover new
            artists and explore the diverse community.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
            The Furry Music Database is meant to be a new community hub for artists, music enthusiasts, and labels within or around the furry fandom. Our mission is to provide a space
            where musicians and labels alike can showcase their presence, get discovered by a new audience, and connect with
            each other.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
            This project is our answer to the increasing difficulty furry musicians are having getting discovered via
            the traditional social media algorithms. Here, there are no algorithms and no filters, just a direct
            link between you and your audience.
